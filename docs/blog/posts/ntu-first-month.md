# The first month in NTU
Life in a brand new and unfamiliar environment is always full of challenges. I am not an exception. I have been in NTU for about a month. I have experienced a lot of things, and I have also learned a lot of things after participating in the orientation camp, both hall's and school's.

## Orientation Camp
### The importantce of Orientation Camp
When it comes to things that you must not miss in NTU, Orientation will be on my top list. NTU has many orientations, such as [Club Orientation](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/orientation/club-orientation), [Hall Orientation](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/orientation/hall-orientation), [School Orientation](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/orientation/school-orientation), etc. Attending these orientations will help you to get to know more about NTU and make more friends (It's true, believe me). And I heard that the friends you had made during the orientation would probably become your long-lasting friends during your study in NTU, even in your future work life. So, if you are a freshie, don't miss the orientation!

### Hall Orientation
I heard one of my Chinese friends said that in NTU, you need to get along well with two kinds of people. The first is people who stay in the same hall as you and the second is the people who are in the same school as you. I strongly agree with him. As a twelver, I think [Hall 12](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/life-at-ntu/accommodation/undergraduate-housing/detail/hall-12) is undoubtedly a very social hall. As the only Chinese in my orientation group, I was deeply impressed by the openness and inclusiveness of the local. During the orientation, I met a lot of people from different schools.I also made a lot of friends. Most importantly, I strongly feel that I and my group members are like a whole family. We cooperate to win the game. Perhaps, this lets me remember the similar feeling in FIRST Robotics Competition. After orientation, we will also get together to have dinner or something else, in order to maintain our friendship. 

### School Orientation
Perhaps, comparing to my hall's orientation, our school's (**S**chool of **C**omputer **S**cience and **E**ngineering, SCSE) orientation is more like a "real" orientation. We have to attend the lectures(but we still have some exciting activities).I think it's also a good thing. Because I can learn more about my school and my major. For example, our school's seniors have provided [a very useful link](https://linktr.ee/interstellarresources) for us to refer to, including the notes for different courses, where to eat in NTU, etc. Also, the friends I had made during this orientation are most likely to be my classmates. So, I think it's also a very important orientation.

## Summary
All in all, life and courses in NTU may not be as easy as you think before. However, I think this will also provide us with a very good opportunity to learn and grow. So, don't be afraid of the challenges you will face in NTU. Just face them bravely. I believe that you will be able to overcome them and become a better person.
