# Computer Organization and Architecture

> These notes may mostly contain my own thoughts after reading and may also contain something l think is important. So, l will use the original book's contents to manage my note.&#x20;

## Preface

In spite of the variety and pace of change in the computer field, certain fundamental concepts apply consistently throughout. That's why we should learn these fundamental concepts of computers. However, l wonder whether these concepts can still be applied in today's computer field as many new technologies, like quantum computing, are booming. l think that someday, humans will use a brand-new computer structure, which may be different from Von Neumann's architecture.&#x20;
