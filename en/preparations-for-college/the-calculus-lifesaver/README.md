# The Calculus Lifesaver

## 3 Introduction to Limits

### 3.2 Left-Hand and Right-Hand Limits

### 3.6 The Sandwich Principle

## 4 How to Solve Limit Problems Involving Polynomials

1. Multiply and divide the **conjugate expression**
2. Multiply and divide **the leading term**
3. Pay attention when solving Limits Involving Rational Functions as x → −∞. For example, $$\sqrt{x^2}=-x$$ under this circumstance.

## 5 Continuity and Differentiability

1. Differentiable functions are automatically continuous.
2. Continuous functions aren’t always differentiable

## 6 How to Solve Differentiation Problems

1. To make sure a piecewise-defined function is differentiable at a point, check its continuity at the join point, then check its differentiability at the join point.

## 7 Trig Limits and Derivatives

1. Remember some important limits with the trig function.
2. Get the hang of using sandwich principles to prove some limits.

## 8 Implicit Differentiation and Related Rates

1. Remember the four steps used in solving problems involving related rates.

## 9 Exponentials and Logarithms

1. Remember the two important limits and the definition of $$e$$

## 10 Inverse Functions and Inverse Trig Functions

## 11 The Derivative and Graphs

1. **The Rolle's Theorem** and the **Mean Value Theorem**
